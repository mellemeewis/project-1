# Process Book Tobias Ma√§tita

## Day 2
Decided on a final deisgn document. To be seen [here](https://github.com/tobiasmaatita/project/tree/master/DESIGN.md).

## Day 3
Decided to change the sequence of the figures: first a line chart of the worldwide literacy

## Day 4
No big decisions, worked on the prototype. Problem: how to show this prototype
without a local host.
