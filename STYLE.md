Ten rules to follow:
1. Use camelCase;
* Max 80 characters;
* No unused variables;
* Space after keywords and functions, e.g. `if () {}` or `function(arg) {};`;
* Use === for equality instead of ==;
* Comments: use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single line comments;
* Use double quotes (`"string"`) for strings instead of single quotes (`'string'`);
* Whitespaces: one before comment, avoid multiple empty lines;
* Commas: no leading commas! Space after comma, not before;
* Use semicolons to close every statement;
* Indentation: two spaces (one tab);
