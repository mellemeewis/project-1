# Styleguide
This is the style guide I made for my final project of the Minor Programmeren.

### Eleven rules to follow
1. Use camelCase
* Try to put a maximum of 80 characters on one line. This increases the readability
of the code.
* There are no unused variables in the code. This prevents confusion and makes for
tidier code.
* Use one blank space after keywords and functions, e.g. `if (a < b) {}` or
  `function(arg) {};` The opening accolades are on the same line as its statement. If
    a function is longer than one line, the function starts below the statement.
    If it is a one-line function, the function can start in the same line. Do
    keep an eye on the 80 characters maximum.
* Use === for equality instead of ==.
* Comments: use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single line comments.
* Use double quotes (`"string"`) for strings instead of single quotes (`'string'`).
* Whitespaces: one before comment, avoid multiple empty lines.
* Commas: no leading commas! Space after comma, not before.
* Indentation: two spaces (one tab).
