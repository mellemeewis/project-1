## Proposal Tobias Ma√§tita (10730109)

For my final project, I will illustrate the worldwide access to education. Up until this day, access to education has never been equal. I hope to show developments over a period of time, for example the last two centuries, but I need to find sufficient data to reach this goal.
Aspects that I would like to show are, for example, the percentage of people who can read or write; the mean time a child will spend in school (in years) and the 

### Layout
**Site**  
The visualizations will be presented on a website. This website will hold both text and visualizations like world maps and graphs, probably line graphs showing a development throughout a certain time period. 

**Map 1**  
The initial view will be a map of the world, showing the percentage of (il)literacy using colors; shifting from red for high illiteracy towards blue when illitarcy is low. 

**Graph 1**  
A graph visualizing the data from Map 1; on the y axis the literacy percentage of the world population (i.e. 0-100) and on the x axis time. Hopefully, I can illustrate that over the course of the last century (maybe even further back in time), illiteracy has declined sharply.

**Map 2**  
Another map of the world, this time showing how many years on average a kid will be schooled in a country. Maybe using different colors than the red-blue spectre used in Map 1.

**Graph 2**  
This graph will highlight a few countries which show problematic developments. OR: This graph will show the data of a selected country. The data will probably shown in a line graph, as we are dealing with development over a certain period of time. 

**More features**  
More features still to come. 

### Interactivity
**Map 1**  
Hovering over a country will show the percentage of its inhabitants that are able to read and write. 
The aspect of time could possibly also be included, as to show the rise or decline of literacy throughout the years. 
At this moment, I do not have a timeframe yet, as I still need to explore the scope of the available data. 

**Map 2**  
Hopefully, I can implement the same interactive features as used in Map 1. 

**Graph 2**  
I hope that I can get this graph to show data from a country selected by the user.
