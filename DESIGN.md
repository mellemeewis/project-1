# Design document
This document states the design of my final project.

## Data
a list of data sources if you will get data from an external source, including information on how your are going to filter and transform the data for your project

The data I will be using can be found inside the [data](https://github.com/tobiasmaatita/project/tree/master/Data) folder. For now, I will only be using the information on [worldwide education attainment](https://github.com/tobiasmaatita/project/blob/master/Data/education_attainment.csv) and [the literacy rate by country](https://github.com/tobiasmaatita/project/blob/master/Data/literacy_rate_by_country.csv). The data in these two datasets is clean to use it, I will convert the .csv-files to .json-files using the converter.py, which can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/tobiasmaatita/project/tree/master/scripts) folder.


## Overview technical components
a diagram with an overview of the technical components of your app (visualizations, scraper etc etc)
as well as descriptions of each of the components and what you need to implement these

Figures:
* literacy rate (static)
* education attainment (interactive)
* other.


## Functionality
a list of APIs or D3 plugins that you will be using to provide functionality in your app
