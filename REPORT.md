### Description
This website visualises the global trends in literacy and educational attainment. To do so, firstly the worldwide literacy rate is examined. Thereafter, the developments in educational attainment, expressed in the highest educational level achieved by a certain rate of the population, are illustrated. The educational attainment can be examined per country, per five years, and per educational level. The following screenshot gives an impression of this closer examination.
